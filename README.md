# Tappy Kiosk Mode

This project is based off of the TappyExternalNfc project and provides a
demonstration of using a TappyBLE in kiosk mode with automatic reconnect
capability. The Tappy Kiosk's scan reports can be seen using the [Tappy
Listener](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taptrack.echimamish)
app from the Tappy External NFC project.
